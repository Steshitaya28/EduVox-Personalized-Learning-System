Project Description:

EduVox is an innovative web application designed to make education more accessible for visually impaired students. By leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies such as speech recognition, text-to-speech (TTS), and image recognition, EduVox provides a comprehensive set of assistive tools that transform traditional learning materials into accessible formats.

Key Features:

Voice-Activated Navigation: Students register and navigate the platform using voice commands, allowing them to select classes, subjects, and chapters hands-free.

Text-to-Speech (TTS): Textbook content is converted into spoken language, enabling students to listen to their study materials. Voice commands allow users to control the playback, including pausing, resuming, reloading, and navigating through the text.

Vision AI for Image Descriptions: Images within study materials are described in detail using TTS, making visual content accessible.

Multilingual Support: EduVox supports multiple languages, including Hindi, ensuring that students from diverse linguistic backgrounds can benefit from the platform.

Feedback Mechanism: A feedback form allows users to provide reviews and suggestions, helping us continually improve the platform.

Subscription Plans: For advanced study, EduVox offers subscription plans that provide access to additional resources, such as help books, self-growth materials, and comics. Impact:

EduVox aims to create an inclusive educational environment where visually impaired students can engage with learning materials effectively. By integrating AI-driven solutions, we enhance accessibility and foster a more inclusive education system that accommodates diverse learning needs and abilities.
